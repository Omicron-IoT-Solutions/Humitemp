# Humitemp®
## General
This repository contains instructions, schematics, packages and examples to program your Humitemp® devices for the different functions that suit your application.

## Description
![DSC_0073](https://github.com/Omicron-IoT-Solutions/Humitemp/assets/141452095/5efd30bd-0e3b-4d95-9e18-2f8a32dd7e29)

The Humitemp® has been designed for on-site visualization and remote monitoring of relative humidity, temperature, and door states in environments or processes that require accurate monitoring of these variables. These devices have an internal sensor to measure Ambient Temperature and Relative Humidity; as well as 2 ports for temperature submersible sensors, or for digital door opening sensors. They are offered with support for a WEB IoT platform for monitoring variables and a 4-digit LCD display.

Given its features and the possibility of connecting external sensors, the Humitemp® is an efficient and reliable solution in applications such as laboratories, blood banks, food production and processing plants, hospitals, cooling rooms, refrigerators, stability chambers, incubators, server rooms, flower farms, refrigerated transport, among many others.

It is possible to perform on-site configurations, accessing the list of configurable parameters through the buttons, to verify or change the value of variables such as alarm limits, measuring adjustments, enable or disable sensors, audible alarm level, publication time, measurement units, among others. At the same time, remote configuration of the device's own parameters is supported, this can be done through the use of an IoT remote configuration platform.

For this purpose, customers are optionally offered a license for the use of a remote monitoring and configuration platform for the device, supported by the manufacturer. Such platform allows the display of real-time dashboards with the variables of interest, presents alarms with visual indications, sends external warning messages via email, SMS, and Telegram messages or via Webhooks, maintains data logs for up to two years, and tracks corrective actions and comments made when alarms have occurred. The use of other user-preferred monitoring platforms is also supported.
